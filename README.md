### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am [Monikrishna Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monikrishnaroy/). I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant of CSE dept at [UNR](https://www.unr.edu/). Prior that I was as a Software Engineer at Samsung R&D Bangladesh Institute (SRBD). I completed my MS & BS degree from the Department of CSE, Jahangirnagar University which is the only fully residential university and the most beautiful campus in our country.

I worked as a Technical Assistant (TA) at Dept. of CSE, JU for six months and also trained students to solve problems efficiently using algorithms & data structures for three years. It was a great, exciting and challenging experience for me. I always enjoy and love to solve various problems using Algorithms & Data structures. I am participating in various programming contests since 2013.

I am mainly interested in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security.
